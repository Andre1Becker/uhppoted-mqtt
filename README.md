# uhppote-mqtt

Wraps the `uhppote-core` device API in an MQTT endpoint for use with access control systems based on the 
*UHPPOTE UT0311-L0x* TCP/IP Wiegand access control boards.

Supported operating systems:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows

## Raison d'Ãªtre

`uhppoted-mqtt` implements an MQTT endpoint that facilitates integration of the access control function with other 
systems (e.g. web servers, mobile applications) where the controller boards are located behind a firewall that does
not allow ingress. 

It also facilitates integration of access control with IoT systems based on [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot),
[Google Cloud IoT](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot) or the [IBM Watson IoT Platform](https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com).
